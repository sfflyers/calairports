## How to edit the *California airports* page

The [*California airports*](https://sfflyers.github.io/calairports/) page is edited by changing the `index.md` file in this github repository. This file is written in [markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown) (refer to the link for information about how to format text in an edits). GitHub Pages processes the markdown file automatically each time a change is made to it to build the actual site (using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)).

Anyone on GitHub can propose a change by submitting a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/). Pull requests then must accepted, and merged to the master branch by the Repository Collaborators before they are visible on the site.

### Adding Images

In your pull request, add any images you'd like to add to the page to the `/img` folder.

Insert the image into the page by adding the following to `index.md` in the appropriate place.

```
![0Q5-Shelter-Cove](/img/IMG_0131.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}
```
The portion in `[]` is the image tag and should be the airport identified and name separated by hypens.

The portion in `()` is the path to your image file.
